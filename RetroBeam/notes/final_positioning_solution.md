# Final Positioning Solution

## Key Discovery
With CENTER alignment in WFF, all digits (including narrow "1") automatically center themselves within their containers. No position adjustments are needed!

## Fixed Positions for All Digits
```
Hour tens:    x="48"   width="60"
Hour ones:    x="135"  width="60"
Colon:        x="209"  width="30"
Minute tens:  x="252"  width="60"
Minute ones:  x="340"  width="60"
```

## Why This Works
- Each digit is contained in a Group with fixed width
- The Text element uses align="CENTER"
- The Imagine font's variable width doesn't affect positioning
- Digit "1" centers itself within the same 60px width as wider digits

## Benefits for Animation
- Digits never shift positions when values change
- Clean beam-up animations possible without layout jumping
- Simplified implementation - no lookup tables needed
- Consistent visual appearance

## Implementation
Simply use the standard positions for all digits and let WFF's CENTER alignment handle the rest!
