## Session Progress

### Breakthrough: Height Transforms Working!
- Successfully implemented height transforms on Rectangle elements
- Key was matching the exact structure of the working seconds progress bar
- Build compiles without errors when using proper syntax

### What Changed
Previous attempts that crashed:
```xml
<Rectangle x="0" y="0" width="73" height="204">
  <Transform target="height" value="..." />
</Rectangle>
```

Working structure:
```xml
<Rectangle x="0" y="0" width="73">  <!-- No height attribute! -->
  <Transform target="height" value="..." />
</Rectangle>
```

### Current Implementation
- All four beams now animate height based on seconds (0-204px over 60s)
- Uses identical formula pattern to seconds progress bar
- Builds successfully, awaiting device test

### Next Steps
1. Test on actual device to confirm runtime behavior
2. Implement proper beam-up animation timing:
   - Trigger on digit changes
   - 175ms extension phase
   - 175ms retraction phase
3. Add particle effects during animation

### Key Learning
The issue wasn't height vs width transforms, but rather:
- Rectangle elements being transformed should not specify the dimension being animated
- Formula syntax must exactly match working examples (proper escaping, single line)
