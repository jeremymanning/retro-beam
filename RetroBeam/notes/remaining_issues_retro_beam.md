# Remaining Issues for Retro Beam Watch Face

Date: 2025-06-17

## Current Status
The Retro Beam watch face has been successfully transformed from "Beam Up Pixel" with the following completed features:
- Yellow (#f5df1d) color scheme for time, AM/PM, progress bar, beams, and heart rate
- White color for seconds, battery, day, and steps
- Added AM/PM indicator, seconds counter, battery percentage, heart rate, and step count
- Repositioned and resized various elements for better layout
- Separated heart and step symbols from their counters with smaller font sizes

## Remaining Issues to Address

1. **AM/PM Text Apostrophe Issue**
   - Current: Shows "'" character in front of AM/PM text
   - Solution: Need to fix the expression syntax to properly handle the AM/PM display without special characters

2. **AM/PM and Seconds Positioning**
   - Move both down by 3 pixels more
   - Current y position: 88

3. **Heart Rate Format**
   - Should always display 3 digits with leading zeros
   - Example: "005 BPM", "050 BPM", "120 BPM"
   - Current format: "%d BPM" needs to change to "%03d BPM"

4. **Shoe Symbol Positioning**
   - Move up 5 pixels (current y: 7)
   - Move left 10 pixels (current x: 135)

5. **Step Count Positioning**
   - Move right 5 pixels (current x: 15)

6. **Sensor Data Not Working**
   - Battery percentage shows 0% instead of actual battery level
   - Heart rate shows 0 BPM instead of actual heart rate
   - Step count shows 00000 instead of actual steps
   - Already added permissions in AndroidManifest.xml:
     - `android.permission.BODY_SENSORS`
     - `android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`
   - May need additional configuration or different WFF expressions

## Technical Notes
- The AM/PM apostrophe issue likely stems from the expression syntax in WFF
- Consider using a different approach or escaping mechanism for the AM/PM text
- All positioning changes are straightforward coordinate adjustments in the watchface.xml file
- Sensor data issue might be emulator-related, but should verify the WFF expressions are correct
