# Session Notes: WFF Implementation Attempt
Date: 2024-06-15

## Summary
We attempted to implement the Beam Up watch face using Watch Face Format (WFF) after discovering that traditional Canvas-based watch faces have compatibility issues with newer Wear OS versions.

## Current Status
- ✅ Successfully created WFF XML structure
- ✅ Created metadata files (watch_face_info.xml)
- ✅ Updated AndroidManifest.xml with WFF metadata
- ✅ APK builds and installs successfully
- ❌ Watch face does NOT appear in the watch face picker on emulator
- ❌ Same issue occurs on real Wear OS device (user's physical watch)

## What We Tried
1. **Canvas-based approach (androidx.wear.watchface)**
   - Modern API approach
   - Built successfully but didn't show in picker

2. **Legacy approach (android.support.wearable.watchface)**
   - Deprecated API
   - Built successfully but didn't show in picker

3. **Watch Face Format (WFF) approach**
   - Created watchface.xml in res/raw/
   - Created watch_face_info.xml in res/xml/
   - Removed all service-based code
   - Multiple metadata configurations in AndroidManifest.xml

## Current Implementation

### File Structure
```
app/src/main/
├── AndroidManifest.xml
├── res/
│   ├── raw/
│   │   └── watchface.xml (WFF definition)
│   ├── xml/
│   │   ├── watch_face.xml (legacy wallpaper descriptor)
│   │   └── watch_face_info.xml (WFF metadata)
│   └── drawable/
│       └── watch_face_preview.png
```

### AndroidManifest.xml Configuration
```xml
<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.wearable.watchface" 
           android:resource="@xml/watch_face_info" />
<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.wearable.watchface.xml" 
           android:resource="@raw/watchface" />
```

## Key Issues & Unknowns

1. **Missing Service/Activity Declaration?**
   - WFF documentation says no service needed
   - But maybe emulator requires something else?

2. **Metadata Keys Confusion**
   - Tried multiple variations:
     - `com.google.android.wearable.watchface.wff`
     - `com.google.android.wearable.watchface.xml`
     - `com.google.android.wearable.watchface.format.version`
   - Not clear which is correct for WFF

3. **Emulator Limitations?**
   - User confirmed emulator DOES support WFF
   - But we can't get ANY watch face approach to show up
   - Same issue on real device

4. **Package/App Structure**
   - Do we need specific package naming?
   - Do we need additional components?
   - Is standalone app configuration correct?

## Next Steps (for next session)

1. **Try Official Samples**
   - Clone https://github.com/android/wear-os-samples/tree/main/WatchFaceFormat
   - See if sample WFF watch faces work on emulator
   - Compare their configuration with ours

2. **Key Differences to Check**
   - Exact metadata keys used
   - Package structure
   - Build configuration
   - Any additional permissions or features

3. **Debugging Ideas**
   - Check logcat for watch face discovery errors
   - Use `adb shell dumpsys` to inspect how other WFF faces register
   - Compare APK contents with working samples

## Technical Details

### Current watchface.xml (simplified for testing)
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<WatchFace width="450" height="450">
    <Metadata key="PREVIEW_TIME" value="10:08:32" />
    <Scene backgroundColor="#000000">
        <DigitalClock x="225" y="225">
            <TimeText format="HH:mm" hourFormat="24">
                <Font family="ROBOTO_MEDIUM" size="72" color="#FFFFFF">
                    <Template>%s</Template>
                </Font>
            </TimeText>
        </DigitalClock>
    </Scene>
</WatchFace>
```

## Environment
- Wear OS emulator: API 35 (Android 15)
- Real device: User's Wear OS watch (also not working)
- Android Studio project with latest Gradle
- Package: com.example.beamupwatchface

## Critical Question
Why doesn't the watch face appear in the picker despite:
- Successful installation
- Proper WFF structure
- All required metadata
- No build or runtime errors

This suggests we're missing a fundamental requirement or configuration that the documentation doesn't clearly specify.
