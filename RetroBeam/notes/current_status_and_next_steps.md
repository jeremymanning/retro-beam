# Current Status and Next Steps

## Current State (Commit: 91c5e3c)

### Problem
Individual digit positioning is NOT working correctly:
- Digits "2" and "4" are clipped on the left side
- Positioning appears incorrect despite using documented coordinates

### What We've Tried
1. **Group wrappers** with PartText at x="0" y="0"
2. **Direct PartText positioning** (current approach)
3. **Wider containers** (width="90" instead of "60")
4. **Adjusted x positions** to prevent clipping

### Current Structure
```xml
<PartText x="48" y="124" width="60" height="100">
  <Text align="CENTER">
    <Font family="@font/imagine_font" size="117" color="#ffffff">
      <Template>1</Template>
    </Font>
  </Text>
</PartText>
```

### Key Issue
We know this worked perfectly before, but we've lost the exact working structure. The positioning logic should be correct based on our notes, but something fundamental about the container/text rendering is wrong.

## What's Working âœ…
- Watch face loads and displays
- Font renders correctly  
- Day/date display works
- Progress bar animates
- Overall layout structure is correct

## Critical Missing Piece ðŸš§
**Exact working digit positioning structure** - we need to find or recreate the precise XML structure that was working for individual digits.

## Next Steps
1. **Find working structure**: Check git history more thoroughly or test different container approaches
2. **Document solution**: When we get it working, immediately document the EXACT structure with commit number
3. **Test systematically**: Try different combinations of Group vs direct positioning
4. **Consider alternatives**: Research if there are other WFF text positioning approaches

## Future Documentation Protocol
When we achieve working states:
- Immediately commit with detailed notes
- Document exact structure in notes/
- Record commit hash for future reference
- Test thoroughly before proceeding

## Lessons Learned
- Complex positioning solutions must be carefully documented immediately
- Working states can be lost easily during iteration
- Need systematic approach to preserve working configurations
