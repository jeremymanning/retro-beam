# Retro Beam

A feature-rich Wear OS watch face that combines classic sci-fi beam animations with modern health and fitness tracking in a beautiful retro aesthetic.

## Description

Retro Beam is an evolved version inspired by the original [Beam Up watch face](https://github.com/C-D-Lewis/beam-up) created by [Chris Lewis](https://github.com/C-D-Lewis) for the [Pebble smartwatch](https://getpebble.com/). This implementation brings the iconic tractor beam animation effect to modern Wear OS devices while adding comprehensive health tracking and a refined retro design.

The watch face displays time in a bold digital format using the classic Imagine font. When digits change, yellow tractor beams animate upward from the bottom of the screen, creating the signature sci-fi "beam up" effect. Beyond the original concept, Retro Beam integrates modern smartwatch features with a carefully crafted yellow and white color scheme.
